# Hi !

Hey, I'm Osaki. 

I discovered development almost 5 years ago when I wanted to create a Discord bot.  
Since then, I've been doing projects, self-hosting (because it's cool, especially Vaultwarden and Nextcloud) and other cool stuff.

## 📁 My Active Project

Here are the 1 main project I'm working on now:

- [**Kazuha**](): My main activity is to maintain the development of my Discord bot I created, **Kazuha**, created Sun Jun 02 2024 to introduce myself to development.

I mainly code my project in JavaScript.

## 📱 Contacting Me

If you have any questions, want to contact me or anything else, I'm available on Discord (osaki17), or by mail (in my GitHub bio).  
However I don't guarantee any answer because I'm too lazy to answer.
